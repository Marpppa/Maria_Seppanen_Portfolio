# Object Oriented Programming
This project work is from an object oriented programming course in the spring of 2020. 
The whole course was dedicated to creating a program using the principles of object oriented programming in Java.

## Running the code
If you wish to run the program, you should add all the files and folders in the current configuration to 
your code editor and run the "Oope2HT.java" file. 

*Note:* this is old code, therefore I can not guarantee that it will run after all this time.
